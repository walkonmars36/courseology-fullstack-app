# courseology-fullstack-app

##  Final Project - Technology Consultancy 12 week programme at \_Nology.io.

The task was to build a full stack app using the following tech stack.

* React frontend
* Java / Spring Boot backend
* MySQL database

This project brought together all the skills developed during the course.

* Using SCSS/SASS 
* Using BEM naming conventions
* Fetching data from an API in React
* Building a backend with Java / Spring Boot
* Creating a local database with MySQL


All the course data is fetched from the API and from there the user can click for more information on the individual course. 
This will fetch the relevant object from the API and display it in course overview. 

There is also search functionality which has access to all the keys on the object, returning any course that has a match 
with the search term, anywhere in the keys' values.

Lastly there is the ability to add a course via the add course form. On submission this will be added to the database.

Below are some screenshots both at mobile and desktop sizes.
